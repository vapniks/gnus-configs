* Installation

 - Put the library in a directory in the emacs load path, like ~/.emacs.d
 - You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
   (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
   where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
   (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
 - Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file: (require 'gnus-configs)
